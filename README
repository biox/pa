  faq
    > how does this differ from pass, passage, etc?

      pa is smaller. simpler. cleaner. plainer.
      harder. better. faster. stronger.
      more than ever, hour after hour
      work is never over

    > is pa secure?

      if you would like to understand the
      security characteristics of pa, please
      read my blog post[2], and my explanation[3].

    > why u make this?

      see [2].

    > where are my keys?

      probably the default locations:
        ~/.local/share/pa/identities
        ~/.local/share/pa/recipients

    > where are my passwords?

      probably the default location:
        ~/.local/share/pa/passwords

    > how do i rename a password?

      cd ~/.local/share/pa/passwords
      mv foo.age bar.age
